Since ancient times, people have been experimenting with methods to hide their secrets and vital information
from the public sight to avoid threats. At the same time, in most of those instances, they wanted their heirs
or beloved ones to know the information after their demise. This means they would reveal the information,
but only a particular person should be able to understand it. So that’s where the concept of ”Encoding” and
”Decoding” arises from.
In Vigenere Cipher, we use a random keyword to encode/encrypt the data, and using the same keyword,
we decode/decrypt the data. The keyword would be told only to that person whom we want to read the text.
What we reveal to the public is the encoded form of the text which can’t generally be understood. Only that
person who has the keyword will be able to decode the revealed text to get the original readable plain text.
